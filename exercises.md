### Exercises

> Practice breaking it down! Choose one of the following to explain as if the listener has never done it before:
What are the steps involved in making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?
What are the steps involved in tying a shoelace?
What are the steps involved in making a cup of coffee?
What are the steps involved in making a phone call?

A: The peanut butter and jelly sandwich:

1. Place a plate on the table
2. Place a piece of bread on that plate
3. take the butter can
4. open the butter can
5. take the knife
6. load the knife with the butter
7. put the butter on the bread with the knife
8. take the jelly bottle
9. open the jelly bottle
10. take a spoon
11. put the jelly with the spoon over the butter on the bread
12. take another piece of bread
13. put the bread over the jelly closing the sandwich
14. you can eat the sandwich

> In our “Say Hi” example, if the Say Hi part of the program never runs, how would you narrow down the cause of the problem? Explain the process and use a roadmap to visualize it.

A: If the ‘say hi’ never works, you should go back to ‘User Button click’ and see if it is working or not, fix it if it is needed, when the button is working and the problem still, so we focus on the next small portion of our program. Then go to ‘User Name Input’ and see what it is going wrong and try to fix it.

> Create a problem-solving example using a roadmap and the process of elimination for narrowing down issues of your own. You already use this skill daily. Break down and explain a problem you solve in your everyday life.

A: When a I want to cook a pizza at home, the problem-solving:

Have all the ingredients --> Put the ingredients in order after the base --> put the pizza on the bake --> when it's cooked, then eat it.

I don't have ingredients for a pizza <-- I forgot the ingredients order <-- the bake is broken <-- Can't eat the pizza.
